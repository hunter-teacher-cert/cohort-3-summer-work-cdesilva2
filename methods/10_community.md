### How It Works
#### Write a Pig Latin translator

Pig Latin is a language or language game. Here are the steps with any word. First, move the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word. Second, add "ay" to the end of the word. For example, the word "banana" would become "ananabay."

Write a method in Java that turns a string that contains words into the equivalent in Pig Latin.

1. Get input string from the user.
2. Write a method that takes a passes the string input taken from the user. ( students have to account for single word and full sentences.)
1. Must print out the origial sentence or words taken from input and then prints out the pig latin translation.  

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
* Students enjoying working with each other 
* Students learn new skills and code from each other
* Tiered Hetherogenous grouping 

#### Rollout Timeline
* Ideally complete for 3-4 hours after school during special acitivity with water and snacks provided.
* Can be done in the classroom to implement it through group work. 

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Students would be given a rubric to guide them in their approach so they will know whats is expected/required of them. 
* Should be one project that each group member can individually explain. The program should be able to run with no compile time error. Students would be given points for partial credit using the code if work doesnt run. 

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Students unsure what to do and may give up without really trying.Students have gotten too much into the habilt of relying and waiting for the teacher to guide and give them the answer. This is great because it really allows the students to becomes independent thinkers and have the power to solve their own problems.
